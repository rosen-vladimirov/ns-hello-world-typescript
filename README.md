# ns-hello-world-typescript
Sample project for NativeScript TypeScript support in AppBuilder.

### Open in AppBuilder
Opening the project in any AppBuilder client should:
* Remove `typings/tns-core-modules` of the project
* Install all dependencies from `package.json`. This should produce `node_modules` directory in which there should be `tns-core-modules` directory.

### Transpilation
The project should be transpiled without any warnings and errors.
